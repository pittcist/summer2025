### Course Description

Welcome to the Intro to Data Analytics course in R and Python, Summer 2025. This course will be taught online via Zoom Meeting from **July 7-10, 2024, 8:00-12:00 BJT**. 

This course is designed for upper-level undergraduate students and graduate students in business programs with a strong interest in data analytics. This course will introduce concepts, tools, and methods related to data collection, cleaning, processing, analysis, and visualization for business operations. Students in this class will benefit from the hands-on teaching style and real-world cases and examples. 

Topics of this course include: markdown (a lightweight markup language), the software package R, R statistical methods, Python programming language, Python web handling, regular expression and other data analytics-related tools and topics. This course is intended for students who plan to seek data analytics-related jobs or apply for graduate schools in information systems and/or data sciences. Students who wish to improve academic research skills may also benefit from this course.

This course will be taught synchronously on **Zoom** each day in the morining . Please use the following Zoom link and passcode to join the class sessions.

### Prerequisite

Although students are not required to have a computer programming background, at least one intro-level programming course and one college-level statistics course prior to taking this course will be very helpful.

***This is an intensive coding class***. We'll spend the majority of time on hands-on coding practices. All students **MUST** bring a personal computer. If you are running Zoom on a tablet, a separate personal computer will be needed for coding. 

It is not recommended to run Zoom on a mobile phone, as you won't be able to see the code on a small screen.

Please follow the enclosed instructions to install the required software on your own computer, including:

- R
- R Studio
- Python
- PyCharm

Please have the above software packages installed on your computer before our first day of class.

### Course Conduct and Policies 

#### Attendance Policy

Attendance is required, and attendance policy will be strictly enforced in compliance with the university policies.

#### Homework/Assignment Policy

#### Make-up Policy

There will be no make-up assignment except in the case of a documented medical emergency.

#### Grading

Students enrolled in this course will receive a grade of either S (Satisfactory) or F (Fail). To earn an S, students must accumulate over 60% of the available credits. Those who do not meet this threshold will receive an F.

#### Professionalism

Students who are uncooperative, rude, and abusive to the instructor or other students will be penalized. Students who habitually show up late, or leave early without appropriate permission, bring food or drink into classrooms, read papers or magazines irrelevant to class instructions, listen to music, or use cell phones during class, use computers in class for anything other than approved class-related activities, or are disruptive in any other way, will be penalized.

#### Academic Integrity

Students are expected to uphold the standard of conduct relating to academic integrity. An individual student is assumed full responsibility for the content and integrity of the academic work he or she submits. The guiding principle of academic integrity shall be that a student’s submitted work, examinations, reports, and projects must be his or her own work.  

All sources must be cited with full references. **Copying ideas, code, and writings from another person and presenting them as if one’s own is plagiarism**. Any form of cheating and plagiarism uncovered will result in an immediate F for that assignment and may lead to a discussion of the situation with the disciplinary officials assigned by the university.

#### Disability Policy

Students with a disability may request an accommodation as early as possible in the term. The instructor will accept verified disability and determine reasonable accommodations for this course.
