This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
plot(cars)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

### Blockquote

> This is an example of blockquote with two paragraphs. This is the first paragraph.  
> This is the second paragraph.  (remember to add two spaces to the end to break the lines)  

### Lists  

Unordered list (must leave an empty line before the list)

- Level 1 First item  
  - Level 2 first item  
  - Level 2 second item  
- Level 1 Second item  

Ordered list (numbers don't matter)

1. Level 1 First item   
    1. Level 2 First item  
    1. Level 2 Second item  
1. Level 2 Second item  

### Task list

- [ ] Something to do  
- [ ] Something else to do
- [x] Something already done  

### Inline code block  

In C Language, we use the `printf();` function to output results.

### Code block

```{C}
printf();
```

### LaTex math blocks (chunks)  

#### Greek Letters  

$$
\alpha + \beta = \gamma  
$$

$$
\lim_{x \to \infty} e^{-x} = 0  
$$
$$
\frac{3}{4}  
$$

$$
\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}
$$

$$
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}
$$

$$
\sum_{i=1}^n  i
$$


## R vectors and calculation  

```{r}
a <- c(1,2,3,4,5)
b = c(2,4,6,8,10)

c = a + b
d = a * 5
e = b / 2

a
b
c
d
e

# square
s = a ** 2
st = sqrt(a)

s
st
```

### R range  

```{r}
1:10
v = c(1:10)

# sequence
se = seq(1, 100, 0.2)
se

# repetition
a
a_rep = rep(a, 5)
a_rep

a_rep_18 = rep(a, l=18)
a_rep_18
```

### R arithemtic operators

#### Modulus (x mod y): x %% y (get the reminder of a division)  
#### Integer division: x %/% y  
 
```{r}
7/2
7%%2
7%/%2
```

### R logical operators  

NOT: !  
OR: |  
AND: &  
EQUAL TO: ==
NOT EQUAL TO: !=

```{r}
a1 = c(1,2,3,4,5)
a2 = c(2,2,2,2,2)

a1 == a2
a1[a1==a2]

a1[a1>3]
```


### R math functions  

```{r}
a = c(1:10)
mean(a)
sd(a)
max(a)
min(a)
sum(a)
sqrt(a)
range(a)

```


### Not available (NA)

```{r}
ds = c(1,2,NA, NA, 6)
ds
mean(ds)
```

### Removal of the missing values

```{r}
is.na(ds)
!is.na(ds)
ds_new = ds[!is.na(ds)]
ds_new
```


```{r}
mtcars
mtcars$mpg
m = mtcars[mtcars$mpg<30, ]
m
```


### R strings
```{r}
s1 = "Hello"
s2 = "World"

paste(s1, s2)
paste0(s1, s2)
paste(s1, sep=",", s2)
```

### R loops

```{r}
for (i in 1:10)
{
  print(i)
}
```

### R matrix
```{r}
max = matrix(1:20, nrow=4, ncol=5)
max

diag(max) = 0
max

max_t = t(max)
max_t
```


```{r}
sports = c("football", "baseball", "basketball")
leagues = c("FIFA", "MLA", "NBA")

max_sports = cbind(sports, leagues)
max_sports

max_sports = rbind(sports, leagues)
max_sports
```
### R plotting  

```{r}
mtcars

x = mtcars$disp
y = mtcars$mpg
plot(x, y)
```

```{r}
x = seq(-2*pi, 2*pi, by=0.01)
y = sin(x)
plot(x,y, col="red")
```
